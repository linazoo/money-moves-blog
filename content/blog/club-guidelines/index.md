## Money Moves Community Rules & Guidelines1

### v.2.2 / March 2022

This document will grow and evolve along with the community.

Additionally, the community rules/guidelines apply to all online and in-person interactions that take place in the Money Moves or at a Money Moves event. If someone is unfamiliar with a rule/guideline, please direct them here.

### About Money Moves

I’m so happy you are here! Welcome!

What this club will be about: This will be a place where women who want to flex their financial-wellness muscles will meet, chat, share tools and information and ask questions about money-related topics (there are MANY: savings, budgeting, debt, investing, spending, the economy, giving back, negotiating, credit scores, +more).
We will be meeting once a month this summer (1 meeting in July and 1 in August) to see where the conversation leads us. Feel free to email me topics that interest you or would like to hear about along with any other questions.
What this club will NOT be about: This club will not be me or anyone else in the club giving you financial advice, peddling any crypto coins or MLMs, or telling you what to invest in. The idea of financial wellness is not one-size-fits-all and I’m not a financial advisor.

### The Host

The Host (Lina) is here to keep the conversations on track (be patient I will get better w time) and to moderate what will be discussed at the club meetings.

### Schedule

#### First Meeting Agenda (Jun 9, 2022)

6:00 - 6:10 Ice breaker (what made you want to join? what came to mind, and what do you want to learn?)

6:10 - 6:25 How did Money Moves come about? Club goals & guidelines & your host.

6:25 - 6:50 Hot topics & Wins: Let's talk money avoidance & tips on how to cope

6:50 - 7:00 Closing remarks & next steps

### Community Guidelines

Our community guidelines are vital to making this space a safer one. If someone is straying away from one of these guidelines, point them in this direction to get ‘em back on track. If you don’t feel comfortable doing that, let the host know and we’ll deal with the situation.

### Community-club Rules

NO RACISM, SEXISM, XENOPHOBIA, HOMOPHOBIA, FATPHOBIA, TRANSPHOBIA IN 👏 THIS 👏 HOUSE 👏

### No business promotions

if you’re looking to reach the Money Moves audience with your business. The Community Club isn’t that space.
You get one warning if you promote your business using the group as a platform. Strike two and we remove you.
Here’s the thing. There is a gray area between promoting your business and sharing your success. We’ll try to make it easier:

#### Celebrate don’t sell

Solicit conversations don’t solicit clicks

#### Respect don’t recruit

If you’re still not sure about whether or not your post counts as a business promotion, we have the #selfpromo thread every Thursday where you can post that gray area stuff.  
This especially applies to Multi-Level Marketing recruitment. If another group member reports you for recruiting for an MLM, we will remove you from the group on strike one.

## What it boils down to:

Be Open, Be Aware, Be Empathetic, Be Productive & Be Kind

1. BE OPEN (Liberated Zone) 💬
   This is the supportive space to say it, ask it, and question it.
   Speak from a place of “I” (don’t generalize your experiences to others) and own your ignorance - we’re all here to learn together. That being said, expect to be held accountable for your words.
   Invite discussion. Think about how you’re phrasing your posts, and make sure it’s clear that you’re open to discussion.

2. BE AWARE (Step Up Step Down) 👀
   We all have different experiences and it’s important to be aware of this when you’re speaking from a place of privilege re: gender, class, race, or sexual orientation. Check yourself.
   Are you monopolizing a conversation? Step down. Do you have something to share that could further the conversation? Please step up - we want to hear you!

3. BE EMPATHETIC
   We are not here to judge anyone or each other

4. BE KIND (R-E-S-P-E-C-T) 💕
   The Golden Rule and all that. Money is touchy and we all have different backgrounds, experiences, and attitudes about it. Respect that and convey your point with the other person’s perspective in mind. We’re all here to learn together and from each other!3
