Hi everyone,

Huge thanks to all who made it to our last Money Moves session this summer!
It was nice seeing familiar faces returning and some new faces as well. I'd love to keep hosting this club in the near future so keep an eye out for our next meeting some time in the middle of fall

In the meantime please consider supporting [Future Front Texas](https://futurefronttexas.org/), thanks to our organization we’re able to host community clubs like this and many more.

### To recap our last session

We started off talking about some cool software called DoNotPay. A self-described “World's First Robot Lawyer”. I heard about this service through a software podcast and naturally, I wanted to share it because it has been brought up before in our club that it’s more expensive to fight for a charge than to just pay the charge. Meanwhile, big corps know they can charge 15 million people a $10 fee and make a lot of money in revenue, and the user won’t be fighting for that money since it costs more time and more money to do so.

DoNotPay has not sponsored this post, but I used one of ther template letters for an unfair charge by a landlord. I’ve talked to at least two people within the last month who are being charged by their old landlords and need to send a physical letter to dispute the charges and [DoNotPay has templates for disputing charges](https://donotpay.com/learn/), to annulling marriages and canceling subscriptions.

### Business Ownership, Freelancing and Passive Income with Elissa at Green Light Talent

The rest of the session was focused on business ownership and we talked to Elissa from Green Light Talent. Elissa shared her story about how she started her business and we started our conversation by talking about some side hustles we’d like to start. Unsurprisingly most of us had some type of idea about a business or side hustle we want to start, or are starting. [Elissa shared a document with all of us which I’ve shared here for reference. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pGjdVYvEeY7QAE_uuJfYVtMTptjzGmhImcX6eQWke54/edit?usp=sharing)

I’ll be in touch soon with info around our next MM session.

Have a nice week!
