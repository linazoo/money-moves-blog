We had our second Money Moves meeting yesterday and I'm so happy about the turn out, yall really came through!!

Huge thanks to everyone who made it to our second Money Moves session yesterday and special thanks to [Future Front Texas](https://futurefronttexas.org/) for providing such a lovely place for us to meet!

It was awesome chatting with everyone about our financial wellness. I have heard from a couple of you after the meet up and it makes me happy to know that youâ€™re getting some nuggets from our conversations.

### To recap what we talked about

(kinda, because you had to be there ðŸ˜‰):

We started off talking about something thatâ€™s been weighing on our minds recently and it was no surprise to many of us that one of those things is student debt and student loan forgiveness. For those of us out of the loop, the interest for student loans has been paused but people with student loans are not sure if they should be paying off their loan now that the interest is paused or if they should wait to see if their loans are forgiven.

### Student Loans & their potential forgiveness?

Iâ€™ve read a couple of threads online about what people are doing and one of the more sensible ones I found stated that you could put the money youâ€™d be paying your loan with in a savings account with a 1-5% growth until we know what the government decides. That way, you will be ready to pay once they start popping off again OR if they are forgiven congratulations to us all we have a little savings.

### Credit Cards

A really hot topic yesterday were credit cards (again!) When we talked about doing something to save money for a trip or saving money on groceries, travel cards and cash-back credit cards (as used by a lot of us). I personally use the Capital One Venture Rewards for traveling points but AMEX and Chase Shappire were also mentioned.

Something I learned about yesterday from yall is using credit card points for grocery shopping. I read up online and some of the recommended cards are AMEX Gold, Citi Custom Cash, and even Venmo! Some people said they used Amex Blue Preferred and Amex Gold after the cap is reached. Also, some of these cards let you downgrade after you reach one year.

Credit cards are a spicy subject because a lot of us were raised thinking they were the devil, and honestly they can be if youâ€™re not managing them right. BUT the perks of learning to use them are huge so start slow and set up that monthly auto payment before you go off spending into the sunset. Like I mentioned yesterday, I treat some of this as a â€˜hobbyâ€™ because that kind of puts my mind into a learning space instead of a space of shame or cluelessness and worry. Someone suggested the blog The Points Guy if you want to know more about credit cards and points (and I see he mentions the ones we talked about yesterday!)

### CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture programs)

An excellent suggestion for grocery shopping while still supporting your local farmers was shopping through a CSA (What is a CSA? A Community Supported Agriculture program is when a person buys a â€˜membershipâ€™ with a farm at the beginning of a seasonâ€“ making an investment up front to share the risks and rewards of the farming cycle. Itâ€™s like a subscription service where every so often (usually every week) youâ€™d receive a box full of whatâ€™s currently growing at the farm. There are several local farms in Austin and the surrounding area that provide wonderful CSA programs.)

Here is some information I found about CSAs in Austin TX:

[Local Harvest](https://www.localharvest.org/austin-tx/csa)
[Farm Stand](https://www.nationalfarmstand.com/shop-farmstands-homepage-launch)
[The Best CSAs and Meat Delivery Services in Austin:](https://austin.eater.com/2020/7/2/21307517/best-csas-meat-delivery-services-austin-farms-texas)
[1915 Farm](https://1915farm.com/)
[Buck Creek Meats](https://www.buckcreekmeat.com/)

We spoke about getting started with investments, being cautious but also taking some risks when it comes to a brokerage account and other investments like crypto.
We spoke about scams and how some of us have been scammed but were fortunate enough to come out of it and move on with some better knowledge.

### Here are some more resources yall mentioned yesterday:

Iâ€™ll be in touch soon with info around Augustâ€™s MM session! Please reach out if you want to request a Hot Topic or if there is something youâ€™re dying to share. Some of us were interested in how to go into the Freelancing world and what that would look like for our financial planning. Some of yall sound like PROs already and we would love to hear about how you were able to get there. If youâ€™re not a PRO yet, but youâ€™re still going through it we would love to hear that as well.

As always, Iâ€™m feeling SO HAPPY about hosting this club and I would love to make it better because I want us to keep meeting and having these conversations. If anyone is interested in joining a Money Moves Slack channel let me know and I can create one for us to keep in touch that way as well.
